# LargeIntegersCalculator

## Overview
LargeIntegersCalculator is a C program created for the COMP2421 course, aiming to perform arithmetic operations on very large integers that exceed standard data types' capacities. By using doubly linked lists, the program avoids the common overflow issues associated with floating-point representations in computer arithmetic.

## Repository Contents
- `LargeIntegerCalculator.c`: Main program source file implementing large integer calculations using linked lists.
- `Project 1 Spring 2023.pdf`: Detailed project instructions and specifications.

## Features
- Accurate arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on large integers.
- Utilization of doubly linked lists to facilitate forward and backward traversal during operations.
- A menu-driven user interface for operation selection and file handling.

## How It Works
The application works in three steps:
1. Reads two large integers from an input file.
2. Offers an interactive menu for the user to choose an arithmetic operation.
3. Performs the operation and writes the result to an output file.

## Usage
Compile the program with a C compiler, such as gcc, and run the executable.

## Contribution
This individual project is designed to reflect personal effort and understanding of linked list data structures and arithmetic algorithms. Therefore, contributions are limited to academic feedback and discussions.
